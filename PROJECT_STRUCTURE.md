# PreProPy Project Structure

This document explains the structure and purpose of each file and directory in the PreProPy package.

## Root Directory Files

- **setup.py**: The primary build script for the package, containing metadata like name, version, author information, and dependencies. It's used by pip to install the package.

- **pyproject.toml**: Specifies the build system requirements for the package. Contains configuration settings for tools like black and isort.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the external dependencies required by the package (pandas and scikit-learn).

- **README.md**: The main documentation file that users see when they visit the package repository. Contains installation instructions, basic usage examples, and features overview.

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributors who want to help develop the package. Includes setup instructions, coding standards, and pull request procedures.

- **LICENSE**: Contains the MIT license text that defines how others can use, modify, and distribute this software.

- **MANIFEST.in**: Specifies additional files (beyond Python modules) to include in the package distribution.

- **demo_usage.py**: A demonstration script showing how to use all the main functions of the package.

- **ml_workflow_example.py**: A more comprehensive example showing how to integrate PreProPy into a complete machine learning workflow.

- **generate_sample_data.py**: A utility script that creates sample datasets for testing and examples.

- **sample_data.csv**: The sample dataset generated by generate_sample_data.py for examples.

## Core Package Directory

### prepropy/

This is the main package directory containing all the functional code:

- **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Imports and exposes the main functions from each module, making them available at the package level. Also defines metadata like version and author information.

- **nullsense.py**: Implements the `handle_nulls()` function for intelligent handling of missing values based on column types.

- **duplichecker.py**: Implements the `drop_duplicates()` and `get_duplicate_stats()` functions for handling duplicate records.

- **scalenpipe.py**: Implements the `scale_pipeline()` and `get_available_scalers()` functions for creating scikit-learn pipelines with various scaling options.

- **cli.py**: Implements the command-line interface for using package functions directly from the terminal.

- **\_\_pycache\_\_/**: Directory containing compiled Python bytecode files (automatically created by Python).

## Documentation

### docs/

Contains detailed documentation beyond the README:

- **usage.md**: In-depth documentation of all package features, including API references, examples, and advanced usage patterns.

## Examples

### examples/

Contains example notebooks and data to help users understand the package:

- **usage_examples.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with interactive examples of package functionality.
- **data/**: Directory containing sample datasets for examples.
  - **sample_data.csv**: Copy of the sample data for use in examples.

## Tests

### tests/

Contains unit tests to ensure the package works correctly:

- **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Makes the tests directory a proper Python package.
- **run_tests.py**: Script to run all the tests in the package.
- **test_nullsense.py**: Unit tests for the nullsense module.
- **test_duplichecker.py**: Unit tests for the duplichecker module.
- **test_scalenpipe.py**: Unit tests for the scalenpipe module.
- **\_\_pycache\_\_/**: Directory containing compiled Python bytecode files for tests.

## Build Artifacts

These directories are created during the build process and are not typically included in version control:

### build/

Contains temporary build files:

- **bdist.win-amd64/**: Platform-specific build artifacts.
- **lib/**: Contains copied and processed package files during build.

### dist/

Contains the distributed package files ready for PyPI upload:

- **prepropy-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl**: Wheel distribution (binary format).
- **prepropy-0.1.0.tar.gz**: Source distribution.

### prepropy.egg-info/

Contains metadata about the package in the Python Egg format:

- **PKG-INFO**: Package metadata in a formatted text file.
- **SOURCES.txt**: List of source files included in the distribution.
- **dependency_links.txt**: External dependency links (if any).
- **entry_points.txt**: Command-line entry points for the package.
- **requires.txt**: Package dependencies.
- **top_level.txt**: Top-level modules in the package.

## Project Workflow

1. **Development**: The main code is in the `prepropy/` directory.
2. **Testing**: Unit tests in the `tests/` directory verify functionality.
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in `README.md`, `docs/`, and examples.
4. **Building**: Using `setup.py` and other build files to create distributions.
5. **Distribution**: The package can be uploaded to PyPI using the files in `dist/`.

This structure follows Python packaging best practices, making the code easy to maintain, test, and distribute.
